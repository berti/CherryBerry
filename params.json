{"name":"Cherryberry","tagline":"A simple pomodoro timer for Android with Google Tasks integration","body":"CherryBerry\r\n===========\r\n\r\nCherryBerry is a simple, unnoficial application of the Pomodoro Technique速 for\r\nAndroid, with planned Google Tasks integration.\r\n\r\nThe Pomodoro Technique\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nAt its core, the Pomodoro Technique速 (http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) is a\r\ntime management technique. You focus on a task for 25 minutes, then take a break\r\nfor 5 minutes, completing a \"pomodoro\". After you finish a pomodoro, you may\r\nstart another one with the same or a different task. After four pomodoros, you\r\nmay reward yourself with a longer break, usually 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nIt's also recommended that you mark any distraction that may happen during a\r\npomodoro. This helps you recognize how much you keep getting distractions and\r\nmotivates you to improve your concentration.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCherryBerry is free software and is distributed under the GPLv3 license.
