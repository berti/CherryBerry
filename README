The Pomodoro Technique
----------------------

At its core, the Pomodoro Technique (http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) is a
time management technique. You focus on a task for 25 minutes, then take a break
for 5 minutes, completing a "pomodoro". After you finish a pomodoro, you may
start another one with the same or a different task. After four pomodoros, you
may reward yourself with a longer break, usually 15 minutes.

It's also recommended that you mark any distraction that may happen during a
pomodoro. This helps you recognize how much you keep getting distractions and
motivates you to improve your concentration.
